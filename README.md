# Bloom
A [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) implementation written in Rust to as a Ruby C-extension.

# Prerequisites
To run the code you must have the following tools (only tested on macOS):
* Ruby (tested on 3.0.1 installed with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
* Rust
* CLang

# Execute
To run the example, from the root of the repository, run `rake`. This will:
* Compile the rust crate.
* Generate a Bundle from the C dynamic library using Ruby's RBConfig.

Then, run `rake console` to run an IRB session with the extension in scope.

Lastly, use the provided `BloomFilter` class.

```
irb(main):001:0> BloomFilter::new
